# trace-back-end
TRACE is a full-stack job application tracking web platform built with the MERN stack.
This repository contains the back-end API, responsible for user authentication and data management across the application.

TRACE is designed to support the entire job lifecycle:

* Users can log and manage job applications, including company, role, and application status

* Each application can have linked follow-ups, allowing users to plan and track outreach on a scheduled basis

* Once a user begins working in a role, they can create ongoing check-ins to record reflections, progress, and overall experience over time

The back end exposes RESTful endpoints that support full CRUD operations for applications, follow-ups, and check-ins, with strict user-based data ownership and authorization.
